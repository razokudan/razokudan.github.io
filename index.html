      <p>Hey there, it is I, nobody! Well, for now at least.</p>
      <p>This site's purpose is to collect all things that I should learn about. And as I found out last year, I learn most efficient when I have to explain to others. Otherwise I will leave <q>the obvious</q> unmentioned, but how do I know if I <em>really</em> comprehend <q>the obvious</q>? So, explaining things to <em>you</em>, dear reader, I can be sure to omit nothing of importance. I hope...</p>
      <p>So this site exists primarily for my own academic success, while I hope you can still profit from at least some of the content. If you have any questions, ideas or you simply want to say <q>hi</q>, you may do so at any time. My e-mail address is in the footer.</p>
      <p>So know click around and discover some stranger's website :)</p>
      <p>Yes, I know, this site is lacking any kind of style sheet for now. Bear with me please, this will all be coming in the not-that-far future.</p>
