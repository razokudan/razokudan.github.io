      <h2>Chemistry</h2>
      
        <p>Let me try to give a summary of all that I am supposed to know. Go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry" target="new tab" rel="noOpener">Wikipedia</a> for more information (or fact checking):</p>
        
        <p><dfn>Chemistry</dfn> is the study of the <em><mark>transformations</mark></em> of substances. <dfn>Substances</dfn> can be single elements (like H HE LI BE B C N O ...) or compounds (like H<sub>2</sub>O C<sub>2</sub>O CH<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> (Oxygen) is not a compound but a diatomic element).</p>
        
        <h3>Mixtures</h3>
        
        <p><em>Mixing</em> substances is part of <em>physics</em>, as the substances do not combine to transform into a new substance. Nonetheless mixtures are part of chemical experiments.</p>
        
        <h4>The three forms of mixtures:</h4>
        
        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>Solutions</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
            <p>A solution consists of at least one <em>solvent</em> in which the <em>solutes</em> are getting diluted into. The solutes will <em>liquefy</em> if they were solids. The substance with the greatest amount in the solution usually is the solvent.</p>
            <p>A <em><dfn>homogeneous</dfn></em> solution has <em>one</em> phase, i.e. it appears uniformly.</p>
            <p>A <em><dfn>heterogeneous</dfn></em> solution has at least <em>two</em> phases, i.e. at least one solute e.g., settles out as a sediment.</p>
            </dd>
            
          <dt><dfn>Suspensions</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
            <p>A fluid (<dfn>external phase</dfn>) containing <em>solid</em> particles (<dfn>internal phase</dfn>)is a suspension. Thus, as the particles are generally visible, a suspension is always heterogeneous. Eventually the particles will settle out.</p>
            <p>Suspensions and colloids are grouped as a <em>dispersion</em>.</p>
            </dd>
            
          <dt><dfn>Colloids</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
            <p>A colloid is like a suspension, but with an internal phase made up of solids in the nano- to micrometer range.</p>
            <p>Suspensions and colloids are grouped as a <em>dispersion</em>.</p>
            </dd>
            
        </dl>
